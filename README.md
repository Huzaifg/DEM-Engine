# SBEL GPU DEM-Engine
_A Duo-GPU DEM solver with complex grain geometry support_

### Description

DEM-Engine, nicknamed _DEME_, does Discrete Element Method simulations:

- using up to two GPUs at the same time (works great on consumer _and_ data center GPUs);
- with the particles having complex shapes represented by clumped spheres;
- with support for customizable contact force models (want to add a non-standard cohesive force, or an electrostatic repulsive force? You got this);
- with emphasis on computational efficiency;
- with support for co-simulation with other C/C++ packages, such as [Chrono](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono).

Currently _DEME_ is a C++ package. We are building a Python wrapper for it.

### Installation

On a Linux machine, install CUDA if you do not already have it. Useful installation instructions may be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and for WSL users, [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html). Make sure `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc --version` give correct returns. Sometimes after installation, `nvcc` and CUDA necessary libraries are not in `$PATH`, and you may have to manually include them. Depending on the version of CUDA you are using, an example:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-12.0/bin:/usr/local/cuda-12.0/lib64/:/usr/local/cuda-12.0/lib64/cmake/
```

Once CUDA is ready, clone this project and then:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This will pull the submodule NVIDIA/jitify so that we can do runtime compilation. 

Then, one typical choice is to make a build directory in it. Then in the build directory, use `cmake` to configure the compilation. An example:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

You may want to use [this information](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1203635/installing-latest-cmake-on-ubuntu-18-04-3-lts-run-via-wsl-openssl-error) if you need to update cmake to the newest. 

We suggest that you install a `cmake` GUI such as `ccmake`, and `ninja_build` generator, to better help you configure the project. In this case, the example above can be done like this alternatively:

```
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake -G Ninja ..
```

You generally do not have to change the build options in the GUI, but preferably you can change `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`, and if you need to install this package as a library you can specify a `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. 

Finally, build the project.

```
ninja
```

Some additional troubleshooting tips for building the project:

- If you see some grammatical errors during compilation, such as `filesystem` not being a member of `std` or arguments not expanded with `...`, then manually setting the flag `TargetCXXStandard` to `STD_CXX17` might help.

After the build process is done, you can start trying out the demos.

- An all-rounder beginner example featuring a bladed mixer interacting with complex shaped particles: `./src/demo/DEMdemo_Mixer`
- A fun game-of-life simulator built with the package, showing the flexibility in terms of how you can use this tool: `./src/demo/DEMdemo_GameOfLife`
- A place to learn how prescribed motions work in this package, using either analytical boundaries or particle-represented boundaries: `./src/demo/DEMdemo_Centrifuge` and `./src/demo/DEMdemo_Sieve`
- More advanced examples showing the usage of the custom additional properties (called _wildcards_) that you can associate with the simulation entities, and use them in the force model and/or change them in simulation then deposit them into the output files: `./src/demo/DEMdemo_Indentation` 

More documentations on this package's usage are being added.

_DEME_ is able to handle mesh-represented bodies with relatively simple physics and their interaction with granular materials, for example a plow with a prescribed velocity, or some projectiles that are launched and then hit the ground. However, if the bodies' physics are complex, say it is a vehicle that has joint-connected parts and a motor with certain driving policies, or the meshed bodies have collisions among themselves that needs to be simulated, then _DEME_ alone is perhaps not enough to manage them. But you can export _DEME_ as a library and use it along with other simulation tools, where _DEME_ is exclusively tasked with handling the granular material (with high efficiency, of course). See the following section.

### Install as C++ library

Set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag in `cmake` GUI to your desired installation path and then 

```
ninja install
```

We provide examples of linking against both [Chrono](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono) and _DEME_ for co-simulations in [chrono-projects](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono-projects/tree/feature/DEME).

More documentations on using this package for  are being added.
